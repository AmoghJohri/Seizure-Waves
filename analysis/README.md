# Seizure-Waves Analysis

To run the analysis with example data, follow those steps:
- change your current working directory in matlab to the toolbox folder:
`cd seizure-waves`
- edit the script main_seizure_waves.m to change parameters if necessary. 
In particular, specify the path to the Chronux toolbox in variable CHRONUX_PATH. 
You can also choose to run the analysis for an interval of 10s of real data recorded
during a seizure or simulated data generated by the model provided in this toolbox.
- run the script main_seizure_waves.m or execute section by section
