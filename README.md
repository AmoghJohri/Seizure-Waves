# Seizure-Waves
Analysis and modeling code for waves of seizure activity.

This repository contains examples of the data analysis and modeling methods developed in:

<i>L.-E. Martinet et al, "Human seizures couple across spatial scales through traveling wave dynamics", submitted, 07/2016.</i>

The folder `analysis` contains MATLAB code to estimate the direction and speed of a traveling wave from a multielectrode recordings.

The folder `modeling` contains MATLAB code to simulate the spatiotemporal dynamics of seizure on a two-dimensional surface.

The folder `data` contains example human microelectrode array data, and data files output from the analysis and simulation procedures.

See the README file in each directory for more details.
